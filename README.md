# SQL Project - Tech Tutoring

## About

Explore my personal project using Stack Overflow's public database to create a tech-focused tutoring agency. Completed in February 2024, this project identifies the most frequently asked-about topics, and even includes a list of potential customers and employees for the agency.

## What is Stack Overflow?
Stack Overflow is a popular online community and question-and-answer platform for programmers and developers. Users can post technical questions, seek assistance with coding issues, and share their expertise by answering questions. The platform covers a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, and development topics. Questions and answers are curated by the community through voting, ensuring that helpful and accurate information rises to the top. Stack Overflow has become a valuable resource for developers of all skill levels to learn, troubleshoot, and engage with a global community of software professionals.

## Define the Goal
The goal of this projct is to:
1. Indentify which areas we should teach at our tutoring agency
2. Find potential tutors in these areas
3. Find potential students in these areas

## The Data

Stack Overflow's database is part of the Stack Exchange network and is used to store and manage the vast amount of content generated by its users. The database contains tables representing various entities such as Users, Posts, Comments, Tags, and more. For example, the "Posts" table includes questions, answers, and other types of content. Each post has information about the user who created it, the creation date, and other metadata. The "Users" table stores information about registered users, including their reputation, join date, and display name. 

## 1

```sql
SELECT TOP 100
    Tags.TagName, 
    COUNT(*) AS TagCount,
    SUM(Posts.ViewCount) AS TotalViewCount
FROM Tags
JOIN PostTags ON Tags.Id = PostTags.TagId
JOIN Posts ON PostTags.PostId = Posts.Id
WHERE Posts.PostTypeId = 1 -- Questions
    AND Posts.CreationDate >= DATEADD(year, -1, GETDATE()) -- Adjust based on your needs
GROUP BY Tags.TagName
ORDER BY TagCount DESC;
```

## 2

```sql
DECLARE @Tag NVARCHAR(35) = LOWER('sql'); -- specify the tag

SELECT TOP 100
    Users.Id AS UserId,
    Users.DisplayName,
    COUNT(*) AS AcceptedAnswersCount  
FROM
    Users
JOIN
    Posts AS Answers ON Users.Id = Answers.OwnerUserId 
JOIN
    Posts AS Questions ON Answers.ParentId = Questions.Id
JOIN
    PostTags ON Questions.Id = PostTags.PostId
JOIN
    Tags ON PostTags.TagId = Tags.Id
WHERE
    Tags.TagName = @Tag
    AND Answers.PostTypeId = 2 -- Answers only
    AND Answers.Id = Questions.AcceptedAnswerId -- Accepted answers only
    AND Answers.CreationDate >= DATEADD(year, -2, GETDATE()) -- Within the last two years
GROUP BY
    Users.Id, Users.DisplayName
ORDER BY
    AcceptedAnswersCount DESC;
```

## 3

```sql
DECLARE @Tag NVARCHAR(35) = LOWER('sql'); -- specify the tag

SELECT TOP 100 Users.Id AS UserId, 
    Users.DisplayName, 
    COUNT(*) AS UnansweredQuestionsCount
FROM Users
JOIN Posts AS Questions ON Users.Id = Questions.OwnerUserId
JOIN PostTags ON Questions.Id = PostTags.PostId
JOIN Tags ON PostTags.TagId = Tags.Id
WHERE Tags.TagName = @Tag
    AND Questions.PostTypeId = 1 -- Questions only
    AND Questions.AcceptedAnswerId IS NULL -- Unanswered questions only
    AND Questions.CreationDate >= DATEADD(month, -6, GETDATE()) -- Within the last six months
GROUP BY Users.Id, Users.DisplayName
ORDER BY UnansweredQuestionsCount DESC
```
